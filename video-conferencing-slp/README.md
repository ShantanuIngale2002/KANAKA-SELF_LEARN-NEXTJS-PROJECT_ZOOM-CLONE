This is ZOOM MEETING WEB-APP CLONE. This is created for educational purpose. The purpose of this project app is to create such a web app where meetings can be held for multiple users.
This app is indeed developed from sctrach but the main functionalities such as meetings and user management are acquired from other service providers.
The service providers are :
  1. Clerk : Its an user management service provider. It provides its services for free to such small scale projects.
              Link : https://clerk.com/
  2. Stream : Its an meeting management service provider and likewise provides free service to small scale projects.
              Link : https://getstream.io/
  3. Shad-cn/ui : Its an open source ui service provider that provides fantastic prebuilt components such as Image, Button and many more.

For bulding this web application, fundamentally I have used 
  > NextJS ( Link : https://nextjs.org/docs ) and for styling tailwind-css ( Link : https://tailwindui.com/components ).


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
