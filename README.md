This is ZOOM MEETING WEB-APP CLONE. This is created for educational purpose. The purpose of this project app is to create such a web app where meetings can be held for multiple users.
This app is indeed developed from sctrach but the main functionalities such as meetings and user management are acquired from other service providers.
The service providers are :
  1. Clerk : Its an user management service provider. It provides its services for free to such small scale projects.

  3. Shad-cn/ui : Its an open source ui service provider that provides fantastic prebuilt components such as Image, Button and many more.

For bulding this web application, fundamentally I have used 
  > NextJS ( Link : https://nextjs.org/docs ) and for styling tailwind-css ( Link : https://tailwindui.com/components ).

This project is not deployed but Vercel (provider of NextJS) are capable of allowing such small project to get deployed on their server.
